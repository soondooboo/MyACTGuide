									<center> <h1>Lesson Learned.</h1> <br> </center>             					                
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> One of the most painful periods of my life involved getting waitlisted and rejected to every Ivy League school I applied to. 
                  Some of the schools offered me interviews, for which I botched some of them and did well on others. Regardless, the results were demoralizing. <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> As someone who had performed well on the ACT and SAT, had straight A's, and was very involved in the community, I felt at that time that I was a shoe-in to these schools. But reality can truly be a slap in the face sometimes. <br/>
                  <p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> Here are some of the takeaway lessons I have gathered looking back at the process and outcome of applying to the Ivy League institutions: <br/> </p1>
                  							<center> <p5> 1. Attitude is truly everything <br/> </p5> </center> 
									<center> <p6> 2. Preparation is key <br/> </p6> </center>
									<center> <p7> 3. Adapt to the outcome <br/> </p7> </center>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> Points 1 and 2 are intrinsically related to each other. By thinking that I was so amazing, I had overlooked the importance of preparing for my interviews with Dartmouth and Princeton. With the former, I showed up to the interview late because I had trouble finding the location, and couldn't even remember which school I was interviewing for. With the latter, and with what could have been an otherwise great interview, I regrettably injected something along the lines of, "I am interested in girls" while talking about my musical interests in playing guitar and listening to music. To this day, the embarrassment of that day sinks over me. Could I have done my research and driven to the location days before just to make sure I knew exactly where it was? Absolutely. Should I have leveraged online resources and help from my high school counselor to tailor my resume for this interview, instead of providing a shoddy resume that comprised a piece of paper and a scissor-cut second portion? Again, yes. Is it also true that having a lack of financial resources probably set me back, as my family wasn't able to hire an admissions consultant who would've left no stone unturned in the process? Yes, yes, yes. <br/>
                  							<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> But here's the thing. That was one moment out of thousands of moments that I have experienced and will continue to experience. In the wise words of Stephen Hawking, "While there is life, there is hope." When I was hit with a waitlist to Harvard, Brown, and UChicago, instead of thinking about what next, I resigned myself to skipping class and basically giving up on all hope. Instead of writing a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI) or leveraging the internet for advice, I withdrew from my friends and peers. My teachers began to notice. Suffice it to say, I had a difficult time adapting to the outcome. <br/>
                  							<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> I can spend the rest of my days pondering "what if," but the value of such thinking can rapidly devolve into becoming poisonous to our thinking and behaving. The truth is, much of life is outside of our control. What defines us is not always what we accomplish but how we adapt to supposed setbacks. <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> Even though I had secured a full-ride to the University of Oklahoma, I had fallen into the thinking that I had failed. Word of advice to any readers preparing to enter college or any momentous chapter of their life, for the matter: don't adopt the mindset I had. <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> Failure truly is in the eye of the beholder. Instead of thinking about what could have been, think about what you can do moving forward to shape a better future. It might even turn out that being where you are now or will be is better for you than what you had envisioned. Don't discount the possiblity, and always adapt to an outcome, regardless of how supposedly negative it appears at that time. <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> The sting of failure may take a long time to subside, but the satisfaction you garner from adjusting quickly and getting back on your feet will stay with you. And even after all these years, even after all this time of watching the Ivory Tower from the distance, I have tremendous hope. Even if I am forever barred from entering the Ivory Tower, I can contribute to society in other ways. As they say, "the grass is always greener on the other side." <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> So if you don't get into the school of your dreams, believe me: you will be alright. This is coming from someone who has experienced it all. Change how you react and view things and make the uttermost of your situation, however negative it appears from the outset, and the world will change around you. I can promise you that. And if you do get in: congratulations. This is just the beginning. <br/>									  
								      	Good luck. I believe in you. </p1>
