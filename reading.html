									<center> <h1>How to read effectively</h1> <br> </center>
									<p1 style="margin-left:10%> Broadly speaking, there are three levels of reading: <br/> </p1>
                  
									<p2> <center><li>1. lip reading</li></center> </p2>
									<p3> <center><li>2. auditory reading/subvocalization</li></center> </p3>
									<p4> <center><li>3. visual reading</li></center> </p4>
                  
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%"> The first level of reading is the most basic and will restrict your reading speed to how quickly your lips move. This is very limiting. Students at this level will typically 
                  struggle with other areas of reading comprehension, such as understanding key phrases or vocabulary. If you are at this level of reading, the surefire remedy is to increase your reading intake and try to move away from lip reading.
                  There really isn't a shortcut to this, and thankfully many students do not have this problem. However, I've seen this tendency even in some of my elite students who perform at a very high level on the reading. That being said, students who do well and lip read are quite rare,
                  and you always want to develop the necessary habits to put yourself in the best position come test day. <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%">  The second level of reading is probably the category under which 90%+ students fall. Subvocalization is just a step above lip reading. You may not be sounding out every vowel physically, but you're still subvocalizing or hearing out every word 
                  as you read. You can probably perform very well on the Reading sections of the ACT or SAT by subvocalizing, but you're still limiting your reading speed by doing so, which brings us to the next level of reading. <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%">  Visual reading does not limit you to the speed with which you're hearing the words, as you would in a conversation. By visually reading, you can scan multiple groupings or phrasings, which become more natural
                  over time as you read more and more. Visual reading also allows you to move beyond reading every word carefully. After all, by reaching this level you've exposed yourself to all the sorts of permutations or patterns of words,
                  such that you can spend your energy on the test focusing on the things that really matter: purpose and tone. This a topic I will touch upon on a later date. Tim Ferriss discusses the subject of <a href= "https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/"> visual reading </a> at length.
                  <br/> </p1>
																						
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%">  Next time you pick up a book or scan through text online, try to read in groupings. Some words are more important than others. 
                  At an obvious level, articles like "the" or "or" are essential to parsing through the text but you sort of imbibe the meaning anyway. Try to layer on top of that. Try not to restrict yourself
                  to any given phrase, especially if it is unfamiliar. 
                  <br/>
									<p1 style="margin-left: 10%">  A lot of times I see students fixate on a phrase or word because they don't understand it, but the irony is that for that very reason one should 
                  not fixate. The odds are that at most one question will be asked about that phrase or word, and sometimes that phrase or word is not asked about at all.
                  These are just a few of the many things to think about when tackling the Reading section on the ACT or SAT.
                  <br/>
									Good luck. </p1>
