									<h1>Repetition is key</h1> <br>
									<p1>I took the ACT eight times. A bit excessive, I know. <br/>
									Looking back, I can say that there were things I could have done to streamline my studying <br/>
									such that it took me less time and practice. Though I ultimately scored in the 99th percentile on the ACT, I stumbled through practices <br/>
									both beneficial and inefficient. What I have done over the years in my tutoring is see some of the same habits, good and bad, that I had inadvertently <br/>
									practiced during my test preparation. <br/>
									It is crucial that you or your student identify practices that work for specifically you and to continuously reinforce those good practices. <br/>
									Otherwise, you are going to be expending a lot of time and energy that otherwise could have been saved had you cut out the unnecessary or harmful habits or practices. <br/>
									So what are some of the harmful habits that both I and my former students have been guilty of? <br/> 
									The first thing I see is a lack of meaningful review in a lot of my students. So many times I see students review their mistakes, say they understand it, and then 
									make the same mistake on a similar problem. This is because they haven't taken the time to really think about what they did wrong and what they could do to improve.
									Another mistake that I have particularly been guilty of is in questioning the right answer: not from a standpoint of why I was incorrect, but, rather, of how the test writers
									got it wrong. This is a very dangerous and energy draining process. Once you start traveling down the road of "I'm right and the test writers are wrong,"
									you are in for a whirlwhind of trouble. <br/>
									The important thing to remember when reinforcing the good habits is to identify any bad habits you may have and constantly reinforcing the good ones. <br/>
									So what are some of these good habits? Though that can vary depending on personality, there are a few fundamental cornerstones you want to develop. <br/>
									
									<span style="float:center;">1. Attitude <br/>
									2. Note-taking <br/>
									3. Memorization <br/>	
									4. Introspection <br/>
									5. Meaningful practice <br/>
									</span>
										
									Having a positive attitude is key to doing well on standardized testing. This also ties into dealing with test anxiety, which I will touch on in a later post. 
									Let's face it: constantly reviewing your mistakes can be exhausting. However, it is critical to your success. By having a positive mindset, you can overcome the inevitable <br/>
									setbacks you encounter along the way and make incremental process. <br/>
									Note-taking and memorization are bedfellows. Particularly on the SAT, there will be formulas and equations you will need to know. There are no ways around it. <br/>
									Introspection is closely tied to attitude. Without that positive mindset, you will have a hard time digging deep and thinking critically about why you were wrong and what you <br/>
									could do next time to improve on your practice.
									The last one goes without saying. However, the word "meaningful" here is paramount. Practice alone may be beneficial but touches on what I discussed earlier. <br/>
									You want to be efficient with your studying. This is especially true for the many students out there who engage in sports or other extracurricular activities.
									After having executed the first four cornerstones, you can hit the ground running and put in the necessary practice. <br/>
									Good luck.
